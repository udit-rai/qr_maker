# qr_maker
A simple QR code generator using Node and Express

I made this as part of Ms. Angela Yus' bootcamp on Full Stack Web Development with Node.js and Postgres. She gave us a backend program task, but I thought to extend it to a full stack, usable application.

And it worked! :)

## Technologies used
 ### Node.js
 ### Express.js
 ### Modules: Gsb-node, bodyparser, qr-image, path
 âš  No Databases functionalities are present. The program will wipe qr after generation, and if someone else has generated it before you used it; your qr code will be replaced with theirs on refresh.

## Issues
 ### Security functionality is currently dormant due to API issues.
